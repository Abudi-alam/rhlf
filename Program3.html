      <h5 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Countless Lives Depend Grace Food Bank</h5>

Countless lives depend on Grace Food Bank. Donate to support their cause

is to see many more food banks all over the nation so that the needy can eat good, healthy food with the respect they deserve. With our food bank, I hope to raise awareness and inspire others to become a part of it.” Grace Food Bank and his team are in dire need of donations as their supporters have come to a standstill due to the pandemic. The ones who used to volunteer are not able to do so physically for the time being.
<br>
Donate ₹ 2500 to Feed 50 Children/People<br>
Donate ₹ 1250 for Grocery Kit for 1 Needy Family<br>

Thousands of lives are now dependent on Grace Food Bank and their generosity. However, Grace Food Bank and his team have been struggling to carry on their noble cause lately.
<br>
He says,“It is a shame that many times we have to send people back because we are unable to procure so much food due to funds restriction. It breaks my heart to send them back empty-handed.”
<br>
The Grace Food Bank is solely relying on the donations made online which will help them keep doing the good work they do. Through your donations, you too can become a part of this noble cause. Every donation made will help feed countless poor, hungry people.

<h5 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Grace Food Bank Langer Seva</h5>

Grace Food bank is a kitchen run in collaboration with social workers. This service has been continuously run by Grace Food Bank for the last 2 years. Here, one time nutritious food is provided to the needy people for just ₹ 10 per day. We do not force any needy person that it is compulsory to give them ₹ 10.

<h5 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Grace Food Bank Tiffin Seva</h5>

Through our organization Tiffin Service, nutritious food of two times is provided to the needy elderly and disabled people at their home. We connect needy people with tiffin service who have difficulty in cooking or if they have a family problem. And this service is available in Bhiwandi city (Urban) right now.

<h5 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Grace Food Bank child feeding Seva</h5>

We provide free one-time lunches to needy children through the Devdoot Child Fitting Service. So far, a total of Eleven schools have been added to this service, in which around Two Thousand  children are benefiting from this service.

<h5 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">What this Campaign about?</h5>
Grace Food Bank is serving around 100-150 people everyday at a price of Rs.10, whereas the actual cost comes around Rs.30 per meal (including rent and salaries).
<br>
To fill the cost gap, we created this campaign to raise enough support to keep serving our people.
<br>
It is very difficult for us to manage finances each month, as we need around Rs. 300,000 every month to keep our operations running to serve our people.
<br>
As the number of people is increasing we need regular support from people like you.
