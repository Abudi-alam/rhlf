To promote water hygiene and facility we work with many local water and sanitation committees to oversee the maintenance of water bodies and water points. We work simultaneously with them to promote sustainability among water related programmes. We organize campaigns to promote safe water, Prevent water, sanitation and hygiene practices among slum areas. We work on many ideas and research on new sanitation products, ideas and tools.

<br>
Clean sanitation facilities prevent many debilitating diseases like diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera. Functional and gender-specific facilities prevent the girl child from dropping out.

<h5 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Providing Hygiene Education</h5>

Real Happiness Of Life Foundation teaches children how to maintain personal hygiene as well as how to maintain sanitary conditions in the newly-built toilets. Something as simple as washing hands or learning to flush goes a long way in preventing illness.
<br>
