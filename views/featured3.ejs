                        <strong>Baby Aanand</strong> (pictured above) was too weak to even play when we discovered him in Mokhada block of Palghar in Maharashtra. When children his age were learning to stand up and walk, Aanand would sit in a corner of his house and stare at the door with blank eyes. He was diagnosed as acutely malnourished by our Volunteers and immediately enrolled for treatment.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>The Curse of Malnutrition</strong><br>
                        Over 9 million children in India suffer from acute malnutrition. Aanand is one of them. With 11 times the risk of death compared to a normal child, acute malnutrition weakens the immune system severely leading to repeated infections and diseases. If not provided immediate treatment, children suffer irreversible physical and psychological damages and in frequent cases, death!
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Defeating the Disease</strong>

                        <strong>Aanand’s arm measurement</strong> showing him to be acutely malnourished (red zone).
                        <br><br>
                        Fortunately, malnutrition is treatable. Early detection could help prevent long-term damages and help a child grow up healthy and strong. Our team of medically qualified Volunteers work day and night in some of the most remote regions to identify and treat malnourished children. We work through a 2-pronged approach – providing immediate treatment and enabling the community to prevent malnutrition in future generations through education.
                        <br><br>
                        We treat malnourished children at our Maternal And Child Health Program through Posan Potli, therapeutic food, medicines, and provide counseling to mothers on breastfeeding, nutrition, hygiene, etc. To enable communities to prevent malnutrition in future generations, we educate them on nutrition for pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and toddlers. We also train Government workers such as ASHA and Anganwadi workers on identifying signs of malnutrition and treating them through referral to Government facilities.
                        <br><br>
                        Help us give children like Aanand a new life.

                        The treatment of a child suffering from acute malnutrition costs roughly Rs. 10,000. This includes Posan Potli, therapeutic food, medicines, counseling. Through the treatment that lasts 8 to 12 weeks, we ensure that the child recovers completely and follow up for further 6 months to make sure there is no relapse.
                        <br><br>
                        Aanand received immediate treatment at our Maternal And Child Health Program and slowly began to show signs of improvement. He is now healthy and a lot more playful than before, and soon he will be completely out of malnutrition. There are many more children like Aanand, battling for life, in Maharashtra, and we need your help to treat them.
