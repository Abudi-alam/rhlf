                        <strong>Baby Aanand</strong> (pictured above) was too weak to even play when we discovered him in Mokhada block of Palghar in Maharashtra. When children his age were learning to stand up and walk, Aanand would sit in a corner of his house and stare at the door with blank eyes. He was diagnosed as acutely malnourished by our Volunteers and immediately enrolled for treatment.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>The Curse of Malnutrition</strong><br>
                        Over 9 million children in India suffer from acute malnutrition. Aanand is one of them. With 11 times the risk of death compared to a normal child, acute malnutrition weakens the immune system severely leading to repeated infections and diseases. If not provided immediate treatment, children suffer irreversible physical and psychological damages and in frequent cases, death!
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Defeating the Disease</strong>

                        <br><br>
                        Fortunately, malnutrition is treatable. Early detection could help prevent long-term damages and help a child grow up healthy and strong. Our team of medically qualified Volunteers work day and night in some of the most remote regions to identify and treat malnourished children. We work through a 2-pronged approach – providing immediate treatment and enabling the community to prevent malnutrition in future generations through education.
                        <br><br>
                        We treat malnourished children at our Maternal And Child Health Program through Posan Potli, therapeutic food, medicines, and provide counseling to mothers on breastfeeding, nutrition, hygiene, etc. To enable communities to prevent malnutrition in future generations, we educate them on nutrition for pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and toddlers. We also train Government workers such as ASHA and Anganwadi workers on identifying signs of malnutrition and treating them through referral to Government facilities.
                        <br><br>
                        Help us give children like Aanand a new life.

                        The treatment of a child suffering from acute malnutrition costs roughly Rs. 10,000. This includes Posan Potli, therapeutic food, medicines, counseling. Through the treatment that lasts 8 to 12 weeks, we ensure that the child recovers completely and follow up for further 6 months to make sure there is no relapse.
                        <br><br>
                        Aanand received immediate treatment at our Maternal And Child Health Program and slowly began to show signs of improvement. He is now healthy and a lot more playful than before, and soon he will be completely out of malnutrition. There are many more children like Aanand, battling for life, in Maharashtra, and we need your help to treat them.

You can download your <strong>10BE</strong> from the ‘My Profile’ section by <strong>31st May</strong> of the next FY and also receive it via email.</p>

                            <p>For example: if you made donations between <strong>April 2023</strong> and <strong>March 2024</strong> (FY 2023-24), you will get your <strong>10BE</strong> by <strong>31st May 2024</strong>, provided you need to claim the <strong>80G</strong> for these donations.</p>

                            <p>Please note that you cannot claim <strong>80G</strong> for donations made between <strong>April 2022</strong> and <strong>March 2023</strong> (FY 2022-23) anymore as the window for claiming it has closed. However, you can still get the <strong>10BEs</strong> for that year if you made <strong>80G</strong> claims on or before <strong>31st July 2023</strong>.</p>

                            At RHLF, we value 100% trust and transparency. It is mandatory for NGOs to send updates to donors,once the campaign is completed. We request you to wait for a few days so that we can deliver the products to our NGO partners and they can distribute them to the needy.Within a month,you would see update(s) in the form of pictures or videos from the NGO in the 'Updates Tab' of the campaign you donated to.
