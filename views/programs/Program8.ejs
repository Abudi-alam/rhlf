        <h6>Women And Children at the Centre of Change</h6>
        <h5 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">A CONTINUUM OF CARE APPROACH</h5>

A continuum of care RMNCH+A (Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health) means working with women and children from birth to adulthood in order to break the intergenerational cycle of poor health.

<br>
Providing mental health and legal services to women facing violence, and improved knowledge and access to planned parenthood<br>
Addressing gender-based inequities is an underlying area of focus across all programmes that Real Happiness Of Life Foundation undertakes, because this is often at the heart of health inequity in communities.
<br>

Addressing the health concerns of women and children by integrating a Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (RMNCH) health care model along with preventable Communicable and Non - Communicable diseases in the vulnerable informal settlements.

<h5 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Our Work</h5>
Intensive intervention on Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCH)<br>

These indicators necessitated a need for interventions through varied strategies to increase awareness, change behaviours and link the communities to the services provided by the Public Health Systems.

<h5 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Intensive intervention on RMNCH</h5>

We have created a protocolised intervention framework for effective identification, referral and follow-up of children with infectious diseases, health promotion education, counselling and home visits of married women in reproductive age, pregnant and lactating women and children between 0 to 6 years in the targeted households.

<h5 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Partnership with Public Health Systems and ICDS and RBSK and NHM and NRHM and NUHM</h5>

We built a robust partnership with public health systems, ICDS, healthcare providers including the frontline workers to improve service delivery through training, capacity building, data sharing and advocacy across Health Posts, Secondary and Tertiary Hospitals and Anganwadis.

<h5 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Community Engagement for Behaviour Change</h5>

We spread awareness with the help of IEC materials and other communication tools used while organising community events like campaigns, rallies, corner and group meetings of community volunteers who then support the public frontline workers like ASHAs and Anganwadi sevikas for door-to-door visits in the area.

<h5 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Referrals and Networking</h5>

While our focus remains on maternal and child health and nutrition, we understand that in urban informal settlements the issues are complex and inter-linked to many peripheral problems. Hence, we connect our communities to Government schemes which can help them in accessing basic services like Public Distribution System(PDS) for rations to provide food security and universal health coverage scheme Ayushman Bharat.
