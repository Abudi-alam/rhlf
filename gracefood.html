With our food bank, I hope to raise awareness and inspire others to become a part of it.” Grace Food Bank and his team are in dire need of donations as their supporters have come to a standstill due to the pandemic.

            He says,“It is a shame that many times we have to send people back because we are unable to procure so much food due to funds restriction. It breaks my heart to send them back empty-handed.” <br>
            The Grace Food Bank is solely relying on the donations made online which will help them keep doing the good work they do. Through your donations, you too can become a part of this noble cause. Every donation made will help feed countless poor, hungry people.</p>

            <p class="mt-3">Grace Food Bank is serving around 100-150 people everyday at a price of Rs.10, whereas the actual cost comes around Rs.30 per meal (including rent and salaries). <br>
                To fill the cost gap, we created this campaign to raise enough support to keep serving our people.
                It is very difficult for us to manage finances each month, as we need around Rs. 300,000 every month to keep our operations running to serve our people. <br>
                As the number of people is increasing we need regular support from people like you.
